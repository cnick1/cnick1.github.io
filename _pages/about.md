About Me
======

I am a first year [Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://mae.ucsd.edu/) PhD student at UC San Diego, working under [Prof. Boris Kramer](http://kramer.ucsd.edu/index.html). 
I am interested in studying geometric mechanics, and in particular the port-Hamiltonian framework. 
I believe that these research areas can give insight into how to perform engineering tasks such as simulation, analysis, and control more effectively. 
In particular, I am interested in developing model reduction methods that can be used for nonlinear, high-dimensional dynamical systems which are ubiquitous throughout science and engineering. 

My background is in Engineering Mechanics, which I studied during my BS and MS degrees at [Virginia Tech](https://beam.vt.edu/graduate/mechanics.html). 
During this time, I was exposed to a variety of problems, ranging from curiosity-driven science to aerospace-application driven problems, such as through my design teams and my internship at Pratt and Whitney. 
Furthermore, my master's work focused on vibration testing, specifically for railroad applications. 
Through all of these experiences, I was exposed to the need for general methods for efficiently simulating and analyzing complex engineering systems with features such as nonlinearity, complex geometry, and so-called "multi-physics" such as fluid-structure interactions (though ultimately there is only one "physics"). 
This has motivated me to shift slightly towards the applied mathematics side of engineering to study model reduction methods during my PhD, which brought me to UCSD to work with Prof. Boris Kramer.


News
======
**June 2022:** I survived the first year of my PhD program! I took some wonderful control theory classes which UCSD's mechanical engineering department has to offer, along with some really stimulating math classes the department offers such as real and functional analysis. I also passed my Department Qualifying Exam (DQE), so I am excited to start my research for the summer. But first, I will be taking a small vacation to Italy to visit family and recover from a challenging year of courses.

**March 2022:** I just returned from attending the [2022 Spring School on Theory and Applications of Port-Hamiltonian Systems](https://www.epc.ed.tum.de/rt/phs2022/) at the beautiful island of Fraueninsel (Chiemsee), Germany. It was a wonderful opportunity to learn about port-Hamiltonian systems, and I met a lot of wonderful colleagues whom I hope to see again in the near future! 

**January 2022:** I've been accepted to the [2022 Spring School on Theory and Applications of Port-Hamiltonian Systems](https://www.epc.ed.tum.de/rt/phs2022/), which I am excited to attend. The workshop will take place March 20-25 in Fraueninsel (Chiemsee), Germany.

**September 2021:** I've moved from Virginia Tech to San Diego to pursue a PhD in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at UCSD with Prof. Boris Kramer. 

**July 2021:** I completed my master's thesis defense! Many thanks to my advisor [Prof. Pablo Tarazaga](https://engineering.tamu.edu/mechanical/profiles/tarazaga-pablo.html) and my committee members Prof. Shane Ross and Prof. John Domann.

**February 2020:** I will be giving a talk at the 38th International Modal Analysis Conference, in Houston, Texas. In my presentation, I will share some results from finite element simulations I have been using to study low-frequency wave propagation in rails for measuring stress non-destructively.

**February 2019:** I will be giving a talk at the 90th Shock and Vibrations Exchange, in Atlanta, Georgia. In my presentation, I will share a new method which Kameron Mize, Dr. tarazaga, and I have worked on to facilitate projection-based component vibration testing.
