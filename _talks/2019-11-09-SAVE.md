[More information here](This presentation detailed an alternative, more efficient method for computing projection matrices for component testing. The improved approach uses a Cholesky decomposition, or equivalently mass-normalizes the eigenvectors, to simplify the computation of a matrix inverse involved in computing the projection matrices.)
