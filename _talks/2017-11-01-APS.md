V0022: Chain coiling and impinging. This video submission to the Gallery of Fluid Motion shows footage of falling chains impacting inclined surfaces. Contrary to common intuition, impacting a surface causes the chains to accelerate rather than slow down, and the dependence of this increased acceleration compared to free-fall does not depend monotonically on the inclination of the surface.
