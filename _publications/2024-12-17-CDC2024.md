excerpt: 'We consider the optimal regulation problem for
nonlinear control-affine dynamical systems. Whereas the linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) considers optimal control of a
linear system with quadratic cost function, we study polynomial
systems with polynomial cost functions; we call this problem the
polynomial-polynomial regulator (PPR). The resulting polynomial feedback laws provide two potential improvements over
linear feedback laws: 1) they more accurately approximate the
optimal control law, requiring lower control costs, and 2) for
some problems they can provide a larger region of stabilization.
We derive explicit formulas for the polynomial approximation
to the value function that solves the optimal control problem; we
also provide scalable algorithms and software that exploit the
tensor structure of the equations for general purpose practical
use. The method is illustrated first on a low-dimensional aircraft
stall stabilization example, for which PPR control recovers the
aircraft from more severe stall conditions than LQR control.
Then we demonstrate the scalability of the approach on a
semidiscretization of a PDE, for which the PPR control reduces
the control cost by approximately 75\% compared to LQR.'
