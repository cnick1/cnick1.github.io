Numerical evaluation of a low-frequency acoustoelastic technique for longitudinal rail stress measurement	Talk	IMAC	38th International Modal Analysis Conference	2020-02-01	Houston, Texas		This presentation investigated the use of Finite Element modeling using Abaqus to investigate stress-dependent wave propagation for the purposes of measuring rail neutral temperature.
A mass-normalized projection approach to component testing	Talk	SAVE	90th Shock and Vibrations Exchange	2019-11-09	Atlanta, Georgia	This presentation detailed an alternative, more efficient method for computing projection matrices for component testing. The improved approach uses a Cholesky decomposition, or equivalently mass-normalizes the eigenvectors, to simplify the computation of a matrix inverse involved in computing the projection matrices.
Chain coiling and impinging	Talk	APS	70th Annual Meeting of the APS Division of Fluid Dynamics	2017-11-01	Online	https://doi.org/10.1103/APS.DFD.2017.GFM.V0022	V0022: Chain coiling and impinging. This video submission to the Gallery of Fluid Motion shows footage of falling chains impacting inclined surfaces. Contrary to common intuition, impacting a surface causes the chains to accelerate rather than slow down, and the dependence of this increased acceleration compared to free-fall does not depend monotonically on the inclination of the surface.
